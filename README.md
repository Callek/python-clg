Command line generator in python
================================

The purpose of this module is to generate a custom command line from a
dictionary. As it is a python dictionary, it is simple to load it from a file in
a specific format (YAML, JSON, ...). The module support multiple subparsers. It
is possible to retrieve arguments and options directly from the object or to
include in the configuration a function in an external module to launch.
